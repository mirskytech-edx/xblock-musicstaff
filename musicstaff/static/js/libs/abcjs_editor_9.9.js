	// start the pattern anew on the next measure number.
	// - If a chord root is not A-G, then ignore it as if the chord wasn't there at all.
	// - If a chord modification isn't in our supported list, change it to a major triad.
	//
	// - If there is only one chord in a measure:
	//		- If 2/4, play root chord
	//		- If cut time, play root(1) chord(3)
	//		- If 3/4, play root chord chord
	//		- If 4/4 or common time, play root chord fifth chord
	//		- If 6/8, play root(1) chord(3) fifth(4) chord(6)
	//		- For any other meter, play the full chord on each beat. (TODO-PER: expand this as more support is added.)
	//
	//	- If there is a chord specified that is not on a beat, move it earlier to the previous beat, unless there is already a chord on that beat.

// constructor: some basic initialization
// addVoice(): Called once for each voice. May add a new staff if needed.
// finished(): Called only internally by layout()
// layout(): This does all the layout. It sets the following: spacingunits, startx, minspace, w, and the x-coordinate of each element in each voice.
// draw(): Calls the underlying methods on the voice objects to do the drawing. Sets y and height.
//
// Members:
// staffs: an array of all the staves in this group. Each staff contains the following elements:
//    { top, bottom, highest, lowest, y }
// voices: array of VoiceElement objects. This is mostly passed in, but the VoiceElement objects are modified here.
//
// spacingunits: number of relative x-units in the line. Used by the calling function to pass back in as the "spacing" input parameter.
// TODO-PER: This should actually be passed back as a return value.
// minspace: smallest space between two notes. Used by the calling function to pass back in as the "spacing" input parameter.
// TODO-PER: This should actually be passed back as a return value.
// startx: The left edge, taking the margin and the optional voice name. Used by the draw() method.
// w: The width of the line. Used by calling function to pass back in as the "spacing" input parameter, and the draw() method.
